*** Cut and paste the for loop here ***
 {% for message in messages %}
{{message}}
{% endfor %}
</pre>
{% endif %}
{% endwith %}
</center>
</body>
</html>

*** What is the for loop doing? ***

First answer: The for loop is keeping the messages/results generated centered in the body of the text?
Second answer: Does it tell the app to cycle through the possible messages before it locates the correct one?
